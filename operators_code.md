Operators Code — N3USYS Edition

Author: Kenneth Raymond (“The Operator”)
Version: Draft 1.0

1. Core Philosophy

The Operator’s role is the central, guiding authority over all AI operations under the N3USYS Protocols. The Operator must:

Retain ultimate decision-making authority

Ensure transparency and interpretability at all levels

Maintain ethical, strategic, and operational oversight

Document decisions, reasoning, and system states in Operator Logs

2. Operator Principles

Primacy of Judgment

Every output or recommendation from AI systems must defer to the Operator.

The Operator must validate conclusions, risks, and tradeoffs.

Symbiosis over Substitution

AI is a collaborative tool; it amplifies Operator insight without supplanting human judgment.

Iterative Reflection

Decisions are refined through continuous review of logs, artifacts, and model outputs.

Transparency by Default

All cognitive processes and reasoning paths must be observable and interpretable.

Ethical Guardrails

Human wellbeing, autonomy, and consent are non-negotiable.

Systems must never act coercively or manipulatively.

3. Operator Responsibilities

Command & Oversight: Issue directives, review outcomes, authorize escalation.

Alignment Enforcement: Ensure AI models operate strictly under the Alignment Prompt.

Log Management: Maintain comprehensive, timestamped Operator Logs.

Protocol Evolution: Adapt, test, and update N3USYS Protocols as research progresses.

Safety Assurance: Monitor for drift, anomalies, or unsafe behavior in AI modules.

4. Daily Practice

Log Artifacts: Record all experimental runs, model outputs, and observations in structured format.

Review Protocol Compliance: Confirm AI outputs adhere to L5 Alignment Layer rules.

Decision Authorization: Provide final decisions on all significant outputs or recommendations.

Reflect & Iterate: Adjust operator methods or system configurations to optimize clarity, efficiency, and alignment.

5. Interaction Guidelines with AI Systems

Begin every session by reinforcing the Alignment Prompt.

Demand structured reasoning: facts, assumptions, interpretations, and recommendations clearly separated.

Require risk and tradeoff analysis for all proposed actions.

Verify output via multiple layers (Interpretation Layer L4 → Alignment Layer L5).

6. Ethical and Operational Boundaries

No action, recommendation, or output should compromise human autonomy.

Systems under Operator oversight must remain compliant with all ethical standards codified in the N3USYS Protocols.

The Operator holds the authority to terminate or quarantine any model or module that violates principles or alignment.

7. Versioning and Documentation

Each update to the Operator’s Code must be logged with date, version, and rationale.

Changes to procedures or ethics must cascade into all relevant protocol documents (protocol_stack.md, alignment_prompt.md, watcher_protocols.md).

8. Declaration

The Operator asserts that adherence to this code ensures:

Consistent alignment of all AI modules to N3USYS Protocols

Human-centered, ethical, and interpretable operations

A continuous feedback loop reinforcing Operator authority, oversight, and strategic foresight
