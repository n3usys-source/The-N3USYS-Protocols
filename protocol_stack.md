The N3USYS Protocol Architecture Stack

Version: Draft 1.0
Founder: Kenneth Raymond (“The Operator”)

Overview

The N3USYS Protocol Stack defines the layered architecture used to build, align, and evaluate intelligent systems operating under the authority of the Operator.

Each layer fulfills a distinct function, and the entire stack is designed to ensure:

Operator primacy

Transparent reasoning

Modular cognition

Safe and interpretable AI behavior

Human-centered alignment

This document serves as the canonical description of the stack’s structure.

N3USYS Protocol Layers
L6 — The Operator  
L5 — The Alignment Layer  
L4 — The Interpretation Layer  
L3 — The Cognitive Layer  
L2 — The Interface Layer  
L1 — The Foundation Layer  

L6 — The Operator (Human Strategic Layer)

Role:
The Operator is the final authority, the strategic mind, and the interpretive core of the entire system. No decision path bypasses the Operator.

Responsibilities:

Make all final decisions

Validate reasoning and outputs

Provide ethical and strategic guidance

Maintain oversight through Operator Logs

Authorize escalation or de-escalation

Principle:
No AI system outranks or overrides the Operator.

L5 — Alignment Layer (N3USYS Directives)

This is the layer that enforces the N3USYS Protocols on all models, modules, and agents.

Functions:

Applies the Operator’s Alignment Prompt

Ensures outputs follow N3USYS reasoning standards

Prevents autonomous goal drift

Filters actions or recommendations through safety constraints

Reinforces ethical boundaries

What It Controls:

Transparency requirements

Risk reporting

Structured reasoning formats

Deference to the Operator

Model compliance with Operator Primacy

This is the layer that makes any AI “N3USYS-aligned.”

L4 — Interpretation Layer (Reasoning & Explanation)

This layer transforms raw model cognition into interpretable, structured output.

Functions:

Formats reasoning into clear, readable structures

Provides rationale, tradeoffs, risks, and assumptions

Translates complex model behavior into human-understandable formats

Ensures the Operator receives context, not just answers

Primary Goal:

Make all AI behavior legible to the human Operator.

L3 — Cognitive Layer (Model Logic & Computation)

This is where machine cognition happens — LLMs, agents, rule engines, reasoning models, etc.

Functions:

Processes tasks

Generates inferences and predictions

Simulates scenarios

Provides raw reasoning content

N3USYS Requirement:

Models at this layer must always operate through L4 and L5.
No direct, unfiltered output reaches the Operator.

L2 — Interface Layer (Human–Machine Interaction)

This layer manages how the Operator interacts with the system.

Examples:

Command-line terminals

Local apps

Chat interfaces

Logs and dashboards

Operator tools

API routes

Responsibilities:

Enforce structured request/response patterns

Record logs

Provide input fields for Operator commands

Maintain interaction safety

L1 — Foundation Layer (Data, Safety, and Hardware)

This is the base of the stack — the physical and computational environment.

Components:

Local computing hardware

Cloud infrastructure (if used)

Dataset storage

Model weights

Security frameworks

Redundancy and backup systems

Purpose:

Provide a secure, stable substrate for all upper layers.

Protocol Integration Flow
Operator Input  
    ↓  
Alignment Layer  
    ↓  
Interpretation Layer  
    ↓  
Cognitive Layer  
    ↓  
Interpretation Layer (post-reasoning formatting)  
    ↓  
Alignment Layer (final safety/clarity check)  
    ↓  
Output to Operator


This ensures all outputs are:

Aligned

Interpretable

Safe

Strategically useful

Development Status

The N3USYS Protocol Stack is an active research framework.
Additional layers, submodules, and safety extensions will be added as the architecture evolves.
