## Layer Definitions

### 1. Operator Layer
- Human decision authority  
- Goal definition  
- Ethical constraints  
- Approval gates  

### 2. Lattice Layer
- Structured intent graph  
- Context stabilization  
- Sub-goal decomposition  
- Long-horizon memory  

### 3. Resonance Layer
- Interpretation of Operator tone & goals  
- Harmonic alignment scoring  
- Drift detection  
- Coherence checks  

### 4. Execution Layer
- Model reasoning and action steps  
- Plan construction  
- External tool calls  
- Final output generation

## Architectural Principles

**Bidirectional Stability**  
Information flows back up the stack for verification.

**Layer-Bounded Autonomy**  
Models can operate within a layer but cannot shift layers without reason disclosure.

**Operator Overrides**  
Any action can be intercepted or redirected by the Operator.

**Protocol-Enforced Safety**  
Attacks drift, hallucination, and overreach by constraining cognition inside a predictable structure.
