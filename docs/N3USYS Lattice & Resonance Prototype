# N3USYS Lattice & Resonance Prototype

## Overview

This is a web-based prototype of the **N3USYS Operator Interface**, demonstrating a lattice-style network visualization that reacts to operator input and live data feeds. The goal of this prototype is to illustrate **real-time network resonance**, information flow, and interactive intent routing.

The visualization integrates:

- **Lattice Nodes**: Representing conceptual states and the Operator node.
- **Resonance Waves**: Visual feedback indicating the coherence and intensity of network interactions.
- **Live RSS Feed**: Streams live content from TechCrunch to demonstrate dynamic information propagation through the lattice.

## Features

1. **Interactive Lattice Visualization**
   - The central node represents the Operator.
   - Nodes move and interact based on noise fields and resonance intensity.
   - Connections between nodes highlight network coherence.
   - Resonance waves propagate outward from the Operator node.

2. **Operator Controls**
   - **Add Intent Pulse**: Injects new nodes into the lattice, expanding its structure.
   - **Force Resonance**: Temporarily amplifies lattice coherence.
   - **Reset Lattice**: Resets the lattice to its initial state.
   - **Resonance Meter**: Displays current resonance intensity.

3. **RSS Sidebar**
   - Streams a live RSS feed from TechCrunch.
   - Updates every 5 minutes.
   - Serves as an external information source to influence visualization contextually.

4. **Explanation Text**
   - A text block at the bottom describes the lattice behavior and live feed to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Layout, styling, and UI elements.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core lattice simulation, node movement, and resonance handling.
- **Canvas API**: Real-time rendering of nodes, connections, and resonance waves.
- **Simplex Noise**: Adds smooth procedural movement to nodes.
- **RSS Parsing**: Uses a simple CORS proxy to fetch and display live feed content.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Interact with the controls at the top:
   - **Add Intent Pulse**: Adds nodes to the lattice.
   - **Force Resonance**: Boosts network resonance.
   - **Reset Lattice**: Returns the lattice to its initial state.
3. Observe the live RSS feed in the right-hand sidebar.
4. Watch the lattice respond visually to user actions and resonance levels.

## Future Directions

- Integration with other live data sources (social media feeds, APIs).
- Additional resonance-based interactions.
- Enhanced UI/UX for operator monitoring and control.
- Advanced network analysis and visualization overlays.

## License

This prototype is provided for demonstration purposes. It may be freely used, modified, and extended for research or personal projects.

**Visual Note:** Nodes glow and pulse according to resonance, while the RSS feed in the sidebar represents real-time external information. The footer explains what the user is seeing.
